# My-Portfolio
 My personal portfolio website
This project is a simple, responsive personal portfolio website created using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to showcase my profile, skills, projects, and contact information in a clean and organized way. The website serves as an online portfolio for internship opportunities and professional connections.The landing page introduces me with a short description and a typewriter effect to make it more engaging. Smooth navigation and a fixed header make it easy to move between sections. Visitors can learn about my background, education, skills, and areas of interest through clearly divided sections.

My projects are displayed with brief descriptions and the main technologies used, giving a quick overview of my practical experience. A simple timeline shows my education history and certifications. The contact section includes my email, phone number, and links to my social profiles, along with a working contact form for direct communication.This portfolio is fully responsive and looks good on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. It was a rewarding experience to build this from scratch without using any frameworks, and it reflects my dedication to web development and my willingness to learn by doing.
